<h3>Board Games and the Internet</h3>

<p>Years ago, it wasn't uncommon to play a game of Risk with someone who lived hundreds, if not thousands of miles away. You would mail your moves to your opponent, and each of you would keep track of the game on your own board. However, as you can imagine, this was a somewhat lengthy process that was often a little anticlimactic when every single turn took weeks to play out. </p>

<p>The internet has changed all of that. Now, you can log onto littlegolem or your online board game system of choice, find an opponent, and play right the way through without a single delay. It's clear that while online gaming primarily falls into the category of those who like games like Counter-Strike, and those who like games more akin to PartyPoker (<a href="http://cz.partypoker.com/">http://cz.partypoker.com/</a>), there are those who love board gaming and want to take it to a digital level. </p>

<p>The digitisation of board games is ongoing. Some are fan-made versions that are usable only on the PC, and some are official games that even stretch to iPad apps that attempt to immerse the player in the game while making use of modern technology. It's an incredible experience to play board games on a touch-screen device, and the integration of online components mean that asynchronous play&mdash;what happened years ago with Risk and the mail-based multiplayer system&mdash;is now a common feature in these apps. </p>

<p>So the next time you're settling in for a night of boardgames, know that having a group of people physically with you isn't a complete necessity any more. Distance is no longer an obstacle for so many activities, and sitting down to challenge others at chess, backgammon, Ticket to Ride, and other games, is something you can do with a basic computer and an internet connection&mdash;or even just your phone. </p>
